# guessing game 
# the user pick a number at random
# the user should then be asked t enter a starting range value and ending range value.
# The computer should inform the player that they will guess the number the player is thinking of in a number of guesses
# equal to the saquare root of the difference of the highest value minus the lowest value squareRoot(highestValue - lowestValue)
# ask the user if the value of the guessed was too high or too low or correct. 
# if correct the declare winning
# if too high then the highest value should be set to 1 - last guess. 
# if too low then the lowest value should be set to last guess + 1.
# The next guess should be determined by a function that returns the median between the highest and lowest value. 
# Before each guess the computer should announce what guess it is on and how many guesses it has left and the value that it is guessing.
# if at any time the high value is less than the low value or the low value is greater than the high value, the computer should tell the player they are cheating.
# if the computer runs out of guesses before getting the correct answer, it should declare the player the winner and end the game
